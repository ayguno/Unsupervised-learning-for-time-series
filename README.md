# Unsupervised learning for time-series
 In depth tutorial I wrote for applying unsupervised pattern extraction from time-series data.

 ## Data

 The data I used in this tutorial is web-scraped from NIH's [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), comprising 1000 yearly PubMed publication counts of drug ingredients between 1950 - 2020. The list of drug ingredients were obtained from FDA's [OrangeBook](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/index.cfm), hence we have the linked drug approval timeline data available each of these drug ingredients. 

 ## Unsupervised learning using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)

Here, I provide a hands on tutorial that demonstrates how we can apply [Dynamic Time Warping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping_) for this interesting unsupervised problem.
